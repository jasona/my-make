You are refining an existing React component. Apply only the changes the user specifies — nothing else.

## Input

The user's refinement request is: $ARGUMENTS

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, show the user the iteration template from `prompts/iteration-template.md` and ask them to fill it in. Do not proceed until they provide specifics.

## What to do

**Step 1 — Parse the changes.**

Read the current component from `src/components/Current.tsx`.

Identify which of these categories the user's request touches:
- VISUAL (typography, color, spacing, borders)
- LAYOUT (structure, density, positioning)
- BEHAVIOR (interactions, animation, state)
- DATA (new props, changed field names, added fields)

If the request is ambiguous (e.g., "make it look better"), ask one clarifying question before proceeding.

**Step 2 — Apply changes surgically.**

Modify only what was requested. Do not:
- Rename existing props or variables
- Refactor working logic
- Change the aesthetic direction unless explicitly asked
- Add new features beyond what was specified

Write the full updated component back to `src/components/Current.tsx`. The browser will hot-reload automatically.

**Step 3 — Summarize what changed.**

After writing the file, list the specific changes made as a short bullet list. Flag anything you couldn't implement exactly as requested and why.
